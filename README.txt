Our project is to build a machine learning based fantasy football auto-drafter that learns how to draft better teams by simulating thousands of historical drafts. The idea is that we collect real NFL player data and create an agent that determines the best position to choose at each round. The model looks at the current draft state, our roster needs, and determines a position. Then, using a position specific neural network, we input all the relevant players left on the board at that position and their features, such as ADP, previous yards, catches, touchdowns, as actions to determine the best player for that position.

We simulate fantasy drafts using historical ADP for the other teams and let our system make picks based on the player data we have collected. After each simulated draft, we evaluate how well the drafted team would have performed in that real season using actual fantasy point totals. Over many simulations, the system adjusts its drafting strategy based on which types of players and decisions consistently lead to stronger teams. This lets it learn general drafting tendencies, such as when certain player profiles, like risky rookies, tend to help or hurt the final outcome.

Over many simulated drafts, the policy evolves into a drafting strategy that selects high reward players more consistently. The final result is a learned drafting policy that determines the best type of player to take in each round, based on real historical outcomes rather than fixed heuristics. All four team members participate directly in the AI components including data processing, environment design, model architecture, simulation, and training. The goal is a fully functional ML model that drafts teams based on learned probabilities rather than static rankings.
